      <h3> What If By- G Eazy</h3>
      <p>What if you never grew up
What if you never got old
What if you never fell off
Rappers who had it just never got cold
What if it wasn't no cops
What if it wasn't no haters
What if the super bowl ever came back to the raiders
If Kobe woulda left the lakers
What if my homies was all livin lavish
Pockets and bellies the fattest
Enjoying All that we can manage
What if we all took advantage
Of everything life had to hand us
All lived in mansions
Money for stashin
All had unlimited credit Transactions
Sometimes I feel
It can happen
If itâ€™s been imagined
Up in my head
What if the schools were free we ain't have to pay for college
What if the fake did not get not acknowledged
What if snitches all stayed in silence
What if instead of throwing salt
We traded guidance</p>

<h3> Holy Key by- Dj Khaled (feat. Big Sean,Kendrick Lammar, and Betty Wright )</h3>
<p>Oh yeah, mhm yeah
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key.....</p>
