      <h2>Unit 1: HTML</h2>
       <ol>
         <li>Question 1: What do you think are the most important vocabulary terms (or key concepts) in this unit? What do you think that they mean?
The most important vocabulary words in this unit are mostly the tags such as: h1, html, !DOCTYPE, div, nav, li, and p. I know that they signify several different tags that are important for coding.</li>

        <li> Question 2: What do you think are the most important skills that you learned in this unit of study? I think that in this unit the most important skills I learned are the skills I was able to gain in coding. Now that I have a basic knowledge over coding and html, I am now a bit wiser when it comes to computers.</li>

<li>Question 3: In what ways have you gotten better at this kind of work? I have gotten much better when it comes to this type of work by becoming more efficent when it comes to coding. I now know more tags that can help me create other things when I am coding. </li>
<li>Question 4: In what ways do you think you need to improve? I would say that I would have to improve on several things that I have not yet mastered, such as making tables, adding links to images, making columns and rows, and adding div tags.</li>
<li>Question 5: What problems did you encounter while you were working on this piece? How did you solve them? During this project I encounterd many problems. For one I had trouble adapting to using Atom, but I was able to adapt and now I have become used to using Atom.
<li>Question 6: What was especially satisfying to you about either the process or the finished product? I was especially satisfied with what I have completed so far, with my index.html and with what I  have learned so far.
<li>Question 7: If you were the teacher, what comments would you make about this piece? I would commet on how this html is well organized and neat, but there are some parts that can be better.
